Take pictures of game from many angles to support proper palletizing job. </span><br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Supplies List</strong> </span><br><strong>1.
                            Pallet</strong> :<span style="color: #808080;"> Usually most pallets are pretty sturdy but most need to be strengthened with a sheet of 3/4" plywood or OSB (Oriented Strand Board). Sometimes added framing is needed depending on the size and weight of the shipment. The length and width of the pallet should always be 4" to 6" larger than the piece being shipped. Never let the piece hang over the sides of the pallet because it will get damaged. Can usually get most pallets for free from department stores, home centers, business parks, or shipping facilities.</span>
                        <br><br><strong>2. Scrap cardboard</strong> : <span style="color: #808080;">Any size will do. You can always cut larger pieces to fit. Always make sure that there are no staples or metal material imbedded in the cardboard. Can get this material for free from most grocery stores and home centers.</span>
                        <br><br><strong>3. Bubble Wrap</strong> : <span style="color: #808080;">1/2" bubble wrap is another good material for wrapping equipment up for shipping. Can be purchased from home centers or moving and storage facilities.</span>
                        <br><br><strong>4. Eye Bolts</strong> : <span style="color: #808080;">Can be acquired from the local hardware store or home center. </span><br><br><strong>5.
                            Ratchet Straps</strong> : <span style="color: #808080;">Used to anchor piece to pallet with eye bolts. Can be purchased from home centers and shipped from Middleburg Heights Office with advance notice. </span><br><br><strong>6.
                            Shrink Wrap</strong> :<span style="color: #808080;"> Used to hold all the protective material together and seal the shipment from nosy freight handlers and truck drivers when in transit. Also recommended to use black if available for security. The less that is known about what we are shipping the less likely it is to be mishandled or opened. This is more for shipments that sit on docks or at the locations waiting to be picked up. Shrink wrap is available at the local home centers and at moving and storage facilities. </span><br><br><strong>7.
                            Tape</strong> : <span style="color: #808080;">A good roll of 3" clear tape will come in handy to affix shipping labels and signage for handling the shipment. Also is used to hold shrink wrap in place and keep it from un-raveling during shipping. Also, is a good security feature because if the tape is disturbed it's like breaking a seal. We will know that if something was un-wrapped, opened, or re-wrapped while it was in transit. Can be purchased at the local home center and most drug stores and shipping retail stores.</span>
                        <br><br><strong>8. 2"x 4" Lumber</strong> : <span style="color: #808080;">May need to have this material to prop piece on pallet especially if the piece has wheels. Can be purchased and cut to size at the local home center.</span>
